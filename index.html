                        <h2>Who I Am, What I Do</h2>
                        <p>I work with founders finding it difficult to explain their product clearly and communicate their brand values to the clients they want to reach. They often feel stuck between a strong product and a message that fails to show why it matters. I step in to close that gap.</p>
                        <p>I’m Wasiu Akindoyin, a Brand and Marketing Strategist for tech brands, and founders. My work blends strategy, psychology, and creative direction to turn complex products into clear narratives that help founders attract capital, convert users, and scale with purpose.</p>
                        <p>I helped a voice AI platform keep more customers, raising retention by 50% and increasing referrals by 2.3x in four months. I guided a SaaS team through a rebrand that lifted trial-to-paid conversions by 45%. I created a brand system for a GovTech company that improved recognition by 60% and cut onboarding time by 30%.</p>
                        <p>I improved positioning for a rental analytics startup and helped them shorten their sales cycle by 40%. I also defined the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for a Web3 brand and helped them attract new investor interest while doubling qualified leads in six months.</p>
                        <p>If you want a brand people understand fast and feel confident buying from, reach out and I’ll walk you through the strongest path to clarity and growth.</p>

                        <h3>Positioning That Makes You the Obvious Choice</h3>
                        <p>Most founders tell me the same thing. People listen, nod, and still miss the point. That is exhausting.</p>
                        <p>I help you define the exact place your brand fits in the market so people finally understand what you do and why it matters.</p>
                        <p>No more competing on price. No more long explanations. Just a message that clicks in seconds and makes the right people pay attention.</p>

                        <h3>Brand Stories That Users and Investors Repeat Without Thinking</h3>
                        <p>If you have ever walked someone through your product and watched the excitement leave their face, you know how painful it is when your message fails to convince you target audience.</p>
                        <p>I help you turn your product into a story with emotion, meaning, and direction.</p>
                        <p>A story that your team can repeat without changing a word. A story customers remember long after the conversation ends. A story that investors feel, not just understand. When the story connects, people lean in.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="service-card fade-in">

                        <h3>Psychology Driven Branding That Builds Trust Fast</h3>
                        <p>Customers do not choose based on logic alone. They choose based on feeling, trust, and familiarity. That is the part most founders overlook.</p>
                        <p>I use human behavior research to shape a brand that feels right the moment people encounter it. This is not about tactics or manipulation.</p>
                        <p>It is about understanding how people decide so your brand speaks to them in a way that feels real and trustworthy. When a brand feels right, it becomes the natural choice.</p>

                        <h3>Launch Strategy That Creates Real Momentum</h3>
                        <p>Many founders regret their launch. It often feels rushed, unclear, or smaller than the work behind it. And once a launch falls flat, it is hard to get that moment back.</p>
                        <p>I help you plan a launch that feels intentional, coordinated, and strong.</p>
                        <p>You will know how to show up, what to highlight, and how to create interest from the people who matter most. The result is simple. A launch that feels like a real beginning, not a forced announcement.</p>

                            <h3>Roark Automations - AI Automation Platform</h3>
                            <p>Roark had a strong Voice AI product but no clear idea of who they should target. Their message focused on features instead of trust, which made it hard for investors and customers to see the value. I reviewed their data, studied user behavior, and found their true high-value segment: mid-market Voice AI teams under pressure to scale with reliability.</p>
                            <p>I built an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) around this insight and rebuilt their narrative around one principle: reliability is reputation. After the rollout, lead quality increased by 55%, engagement doubled among technical buyers, and investors gained confidence because the company finally had a focused story everyone understood.</p>

                            <h3>Kestral AI</h3>
                            <p>Kestral built a brilliant AI product for product teams, but their story felt flat. They spoke in features instead of impact, which made the brand feel functional instead of valuable. They had traction but no momentum, and they were getting lost in a noisy market. I stepped in to reposition the company and build a go-to-market strategy that matched the strength of their product. Through market mapping and user insight sessions, I identified their real category as Intelligent Product Development, not “another AI tool.”</p>
                            <p>I shaped their brand around clarity, confidence, and emotional relief for overwhelmed product teams. I rebuilt their narrative, reshaped their messaging, and aligned their outbound, inbound, and partnership motions around this new position. Within 90 days, qualified inbound leads grew by 40%, engagement tripled on LinkedIn, and demo-to-close time dropped by 28%. Kestral went from a feature-heavy AI platform to the trusted intelligence layer for modern product teams.</p>

                            <h3>EffiGov - GovTech Automation</h3>
                            <p>EffiGov had a strong mission but no unified brand to express it. Their product helped cities serve residents with accuracy and care, yet the message felt scattered and too focused on technology. I stepped in to build a full brand book that captured the heart of their work. I defined their story, shaped their purpose, and positioned them as the trusted AI partner for local governments that want to modernize service without losing the human connection.</p>
                            <p>I built a narrative rooted in empathy, reliability, and inclusivity, and aligned their messaging, voice, identity, and strategy around that story. The result was a brand leaders understood instantly and a system that cut onboarding time by 30% while strengthening how the company showed its value to cities and partners.</p>
